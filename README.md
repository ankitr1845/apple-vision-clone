This project is a clone of the Apple Vision Pro landing page, designed to replicate Apple's signature sleek and modern aesthetic. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the page is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across different screen sizes. Special attention has been given to smooth animations and transitions, capturing the premium feel of Apple's website.
The goal of this project was to practice front-end development by recreating a high-quality landing page while focusing on design precision, responsiveness, and performance optimization.
